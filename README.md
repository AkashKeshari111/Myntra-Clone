The login and signup pages also check if the phone number is valid, and after otp is entered, logs the user in. 


The navbar shows all the pages, the displayed products on the pages are appended with js, so it can all be filtered in terms of colour, brand, price bracket, and discount. It can also be sorted by popularity, price ascending or descending, new items, etc. It can then be added into the wishlist where it displays the products, or an empty message if it is empty. From the wishlist it can be added to the cart page, input the delivery information, and then allows you to place the order and checkout.
